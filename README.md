# ADAM AI
<p align="center">
An AI capable of solving complex mazes, using the genetic algorithm based on Code Bullet's creation.
  
Built with the help of the lovely mind and hard work of [@gazijarin](https://github.com/GaziJarin).

This is an artificial intelligence made to mock the basics of the concepts of evolution. Think "survival of the fittest" where the most adept bot transfers its "genes" to the next generation. Each generation travels further and further, with increasing number of moves towards each sequential checkpoint that leads it to the end of the complex maze. Through genrations of training, it learns to not only find the most efficient route to each checkpoint but also finds the safest route, evading the multiple enemies that may even trump human players. It will learn to evade and dodge these foes as it makes its way to victory, showing just how capable a simple program can become.

The maze also allows you, the Human Player, to try your hand at it.

You can find out more on this Genetic Algorithm from [Code Bullet](https://github.com/Code-Bullet) and even follow the tutorials on his YouTube channel.
